This is a web-scraper to gather all cars and trucks in the US listed on Craiglist into a single data file with their attributes such as odometer, price, year etc.
I am currently working on creating an extra script which will apply a machine learning algorithm to the scraper's resulting dataset in order to do price prediction (and therefore potentially identify good buyingg opportunities).
I intend to upload said extra script as soon as I am finished building it.
